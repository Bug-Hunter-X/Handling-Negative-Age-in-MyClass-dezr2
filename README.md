# Handling Negative Age in MyClass

This Scala code demonstrates a common error handling scenario. The `MyClass` class has an `age` property that prevents setting a negative age. However, the exception message can be improved for better debugging.

## Bug

The existing exception message is generic. A more descriptive message would help in identifying and resolving the issue quickly.

## Solution

The solution provides a more detailed exception message indicating the incorrect age and the class name where the problem occurred.
